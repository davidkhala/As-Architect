# History
Older than internet: Electronic mail was used well before the internet was born.
- In the initial days (way back in 1965), a computer program called MAILBOX was used to share mail in electronic form. A single computer was used by multiple users to send and read emails.
- In 1969, ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was implemented to share electronic mail using a common network connecting numerous computers across various departments.
- Later in 1971, Ray Tomlinson identified a way to send messages between users on different hosts using the @ symbol with the destination server. However, this was still within an organization using a common network.

At one point, organizations wanted to communicate with people on a different network. The need for communication between one organization to another organization led to the invention of the Internet.
# Types
User email address
- This is the email address of a user/member in your organization.

Group email address
- This is a common email address shared between multiple members of your organization.
- For example, the marketing team of an organization may have many users and sending an email to the team can be achieved by creating a group email address such as marketing@domainname.com.
