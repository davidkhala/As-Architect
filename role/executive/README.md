## Executive Leadership

> Seeing what's possible is the first step to making it possible. Seeing how it could be helps motivate us to plan for how it can be and then take action to make it be.
> Energizing people without empowering them can leave them frustrated. Empowering them without energizing them can leave them overwhelmed, stuck in placed. Highly successful leaders know you consistently need to energize and empower your people, and you need to do both. ---- John Ullmen
