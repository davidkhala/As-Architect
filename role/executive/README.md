## Executive Leadership

> Seeing what's possible is the first step to making it possible. Seeing how it could be helps motivate us to plan for how it can be and then take action to make it be.
> Energizing people without empowering them can leave them frustrated. Empowering them without energizing them can leave them overwhelmed, stuck in placed. Highly successful leaders know you consistently need to energize and empower your people, and you need to do both. ---- John Ullmen

## [Practice empathy](https://www.liquibase.com/resources/guides/database-devops)
Change isn’t easy. It may seem counterintuitive when you’re trying to deliver results faster, but it’s important to take time to listen and empathize with everyone on the team.

Make sure you put a system in place that allows everyone on the team to voice concerns. Everyone on the team needs to understand how the system will work so they understand how to bring up issues they encounter and what will happen next so that there’s a path forward to solving problems.

Some teams do health checks at the end of each sprint, where team members can rate their feelings about various factors including teamwork and support. Consistent negative ratings can tell you that there’s a systemic issue that needs attention. Managers can also specifically ask in 1:1s about how communication is or is not working to identify patterns.
