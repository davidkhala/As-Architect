# Managing your audience's brain and attention


## Reptilian System of brain
the most primitive part of the brain
- responsible for survival instincts such as the fight or flight response. 
- It reacts to fear, risk, and immediate threats, often leading to defensive or shutdown behaviors if triggered.

Avoid activating the Reptilian System unnecessarily
- encourages constructive engagement rather than fear is key to maintaining a meaningful connection.

## Limbic System of Brain
the emotional center of the brain
- determining what captures our attention.
- It acts as a gateway to emotions, influencing how we perceive and prioritize information.

To effectively engage the Limbic System, it is essential to create a focused and emotionally resonant message. 
- using techniques such as storytelling or highlighting relatable examples.
- To spark creativity, feed your brain material like you're cramming for a tough test. Then stop thinking about the problem you want to solve. Go surfing or take a leisurely walk. Research shows that letting your mind wander fosters creativity.

Time to breathe
- meditation helps you spot and solve problems in creative ways. It promotes divergent thinking that gets novel ideas flowing.
- meditation also makes you more open to considering new solutions. 

## Neocortex of Brain
The most advanced part of the brain
- responsible for higher-order functions such as memory, reasoning, and decision-making.
- It processes information through repetition and association

To leverage the Neocortex effectively, reinforce key points through repetition and use familiar language or concepts to build associations. 
- This approach helps your audience retain information and connect it to their own motivations and needs, ensuring your message has a lasting impact.
