## Absolutely FABulous

The Feature-Advantage-Benefit (FAB) approach focuses on connecting the features of your product to the specific advantages it provides and, ultimately, to the value it brings to the customer.

Customers don’t care about features. They want to know what benefits they will receive. Don’t pitch the features. Understand the value to the customer and showcase the benefits for them!
