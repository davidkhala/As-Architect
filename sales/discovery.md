# Uncover Key Issues

1. Get all the issues out
  - Ensure all potential issues are on the table before delving into specifics. Ask prompting questions and use your expertise to help customers uncover any hidden challenges.
2. Make sure it’s a complete list
  - Don’t settle for the first issues mentioned. Guide the customer to share all concerns and validate that the list is comprehensive. Sometimes the most critical issue is hidden beneath the surface.
3. Add your own
  - Based on your experience and knowledge, suggest additional issues that may have been overlooked. This helps create a more accurate and useful problem map for the customer.
4. Prioritize the list with the customer
  - Work with the customer to prioritize the list of issues, starting with the most pressing. This ensures you focus on what delivers the most business value and impact.
