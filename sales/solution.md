# Stage 2: solution development & technical evaluation

When a well-founded discovery process has been established, and the potential opportunity passes the qualifying criteria, it progresses to the solution development or technical evaluation stage. This is the stage at which you present the solution and drive toward a ‘technical win.’ This could involve technical demonstrations, detailed discussions, proof of concept, and tailored presentations that showcase how Google Cloud can solve the customer’s specific challenges.

When you have effectively discovered the customer’s business issues in Stage 1, you will be able to clearly link the features and capabilities of your solution to the business value that it will deliver. This will improve your engagement with the customer and strengthen your differentiation.  

As you build the customer's confidence with your expertise, you'll agree on mutually defined success criteria, precisely addressing all their technical requirements. Your position paves the way for the final stages of the sales process, namely, negotiations and closing.


## The Risk of Doing Nothing

As a Pre-Sales or Customer Engineer, you must proactively address these fears during the technical evaluation stage, providing the reassurance they need and helping the customer understand the risks or costs of doing nothing.
