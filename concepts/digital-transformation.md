# Digital transformation
- is the integration of **digital technology** into **all areas of a business**
- fundamentally changing how you **operate** and **deliver value** to customers
- a **cultural change** that requires organizations to continually **challenge the status quo**, experiment, and get **comfortable with failure**
- It liberates the data from being at rest (e.g. db behind and API) to being at motion consumable in real time as events happen throughout the business
