## Dependency Inversion
Dependency Inversion is a general design guideline
- *High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions*
- *Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions*
- *Classes should only have direct relationships with high-level abstractions*
