# [Compared to SOA](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/soa-vs-microservices)
- Larger, centralized teams can manage SOA. Microservices demand a higher degree of expertise and collaboration within smaller teams.
- SOA involves more centralized planning and integration. Microservice architecture facilitates faster development with independent deployments.
- SOA highlights on reusability and interoperability. Require strong governance structure and mature development processes.
- Microservice highlights on speed, agility, flexibility, and fault isolation. Require companies with a DevOps culture focusing on continuous delivery.

# Drawback
Don't use microservice if you write application which is
- small
- Not business critical
