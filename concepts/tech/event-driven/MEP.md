# Messaging Exchange Patterns (MEPs)
Most applications can be reduced to a series of interactions that adhere to one of the below 3 patterns
## pattern: Publish-Subscribe

Messages sent by the Producer are processed multiple times by different consumers. 

Each consumer receives its own copy of the message for processing.
## pattern: Point-to-Point

Messages sent by the Producer are processed by a single Consumer.
### p2p extension: Non-Exclusive Consumption

by using consumer groupsâ€”multiple consumers sharing a single channel or queue. 

The scale of the overall receiving application is increased by having multiple consumers, but each message is still only delivered to a single endpoint. 

## pattern: Request-Reply

applications achieve two-way communication using separate point-to-point channels: one for requests, and another for replies.
